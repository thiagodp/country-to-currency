[Available formats]() include [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) (therefore [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) and [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS)) and

### TypeScript

From version `1.1.0` on, there are two union types available (TypeScript 3.4+ only):
- `Currencies`, that contains all the currencies;
- `Countries`, that contains all the countries.

Example (TypeScript on NodeJS):
```typescript
  import countryToCurrency, { Currencies, Countries } from "country-to-currency";
```

### Browser - without installing anything

Global:
```html
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/country-to-currency" ></script>
<script>
  console.log( countryToCurrency ); // {AF: "AFN", AX: "EUR", ... }
  console.log( countryToCurrency[ 'US' ] ); // USD
  console.log( countryToCurrency[ 'DE' ] ); // EUR
  console.log( countryToCurrency[ 'BR' ] ); // BRL
</script>
```

ESM:
```html
<script type="module" >
  import countryToCurrency from "https://unpkg.com/country-to-currency/index.esm.js";
  console.log( countryToCurrency[ 'US' ] ); // USD
</script>
```

### NodeJS
```js
const countryToCurrency = require( 'country-to-currency' );
console.log( countryToCurrency[ 'US' ] ); // USD
